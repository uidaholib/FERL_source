We collected and radio-tagged 789 (2013) and 799 (2014) adult steelhead at Bonneville Dam and used radiotelemetry and PIT tags to monitor their behaviors and distribution. Each annual sample was split into two study groups: an early-run group that was collected from June through August, and a late-run group that was collected in September and October. The samples were weighted for late-run fish because they were more likely to overwinter in the FCRPS and because the late-run, ‘B-group’ steelhead are a management and conservation priority. A substantial portion of the run in late summer could not be sampled due to high temperatures in both years. Tissue samples were collected for all steelhead, and parentage-based tagging (PBT) and genetic stock identification (GSI) was used to help assign fish to tributary populations.","Steelhead, Oncorhynchus mykiss",Bonneville Dam; Columbia River; Snake River; McNary Dam; John Day Dam; The Dalles Dam,salmonids; Federal Columbia River Power System; FCPRS; overwintering; migration; PIT tags; telemetry; parentage-based tagging; genetic stock identification,"University of Idaho, Fish Ecology Research Lab",eng,?,?,application/pdf,Text

These results were compared to proximate analysis of fish tissues, which represented the true value of energy content for these fish. Although all estimate methods produced results that were significantly correlated with proximate analysis, bioelectrical impedance and condition factor were less accurate than morphometrics and the Distell Fatmeter. Bioelectrical impedance did not seem to be as accurate in salmon as with other fish species, and is generally considered of better use for mammals. Although condition factor was included as a factor in many models to predict energy condition, its lipid estimation qualities by itself are suboptimal. From a series of 12 morphometric measures, breadth at anus, hump height and mideye to hyperal length together provided the best method for determining lipid content. These three measures were used in subsequent years. Although morphometrics proved to be the most accurate method for estimating energy condition, the Distell Fatmeter was also accurate, and had the added benefit of a reduced handling time. Either of these two methods are recommended to be used in further research when a quick and accurate measure of lipid content is needed.","Chinook salmon, Oncorhynchus tshawytscha",South Fork Salmon River; Columbia River; Lower Snake River,salmonids; Federal Columbia River Power System; FCPRS; radiotelemetry; migration; PIT tags; passage behavior; bioenergetics; condition; reproduction,"University of Idaho, Fish Ecology Research Lab",eng,?,?,application/pdf,Text

Migration paths of 28 individual fish tagged with RDSTs were monitored in the tailraces of Bonneville and Ice Harbor dams and combined with output from a two-dimensional dissolved gas model to estimate the degree of uncompensated dissolved gas exposure.","Steelhead, Oncorhynchus mykiss",Bonneville Dam; Columbia River; Snake River; Lower Granite Dam; The Dalles Dam; John Day Dam; McNary Dam; Ice Harbor Dam; Lower Monumental Dam; Little Goose Dam,salmonids; Federal Columbia River Power System; FCPRS; radiotelemetry; dissolved gas concentrations; migration depth; fish physiology; gas bubble disease,"University of Idaho, Fish Ecology Research Lab",eng,?,?,application/pdf,Text

In 2001 and 2002, we conducted an experiment to determine if modified weirs affected adult salmon and steelhead passage times and route selection through the Lower Granite Dam transition pool. Attraction flows through weir orifices were experimentally manipulated using removable aluminum panels. Results from these studies indicated a greater proportion of radio-tagged spring– summer Chinook salmon passed straight through the transition pool when the panels were deployed, and mean transition pool passage times were significantly lower. Based on these results, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers modified the fish ladder at Lower Granite Dam in 2006. Modifications included narrowing the junction pool walls and increasing the weir crest height of the lower eleven weirs. To evaluate the effectiveness of the modifications, we radio-tagged and monitored adult spring–summer and fall Chinook salmon and steelhead as they passed Little Goose and Lower Granite dams and compared their performance to that measured during previous years without modifications in place. Transition pool passage times at Lower Granite Dam for spring– summer Chinook were significantly faster in 2006 than in 2003 and 2004 (non-modified years) and the other runs exhibited similar, though not statistically different responses. The frequency of downstream exits out of the transition pool back to the collection channel or tailrace for spring-summer Chinook salmon at Lower Granite Dam in 2006 were lower than in 2003 and 2004. We also compared the relative passage times by individual fish at Little Goose and Lower Granite dams in an effort to statistically control for interannual variation river environment. For all runs, we found that passage time was relatively faster at Lower Granite Dam compared to Little Goose Dam in 2006 versus 2003 and 2004. While the results generally support the hypothesis that the weir modifications improved passage and provide no evidence that the modifications worsened passage conditions, we caution that rigorous conclusions can not be made because behaviors were made for only one year post-modification and inter-annual variability in pool passage times can be high.","Steelhead, Oncorhynchus mykiss; Chinook salmon, Oncorhynchus tshawytscha",Lower Granite Dam; Columbia River,salmonids; Federal Columbia River Power System; FCPRS; radiotelemetry; migration; passage behavior; fishways; modifications,"University of Idaho, Fish Ecology Research Lab",eng,?,?,application/pdf,Text

Full-dam passage times were only weakly correlated with environmental conditions, including flow, spill, and water temperature. In general, passage times were longer during higher flow and spill and when water temperatures were either relatively high (> 17º C) or low (< 10º C). Full-dam passage times were more strongly correlated with fishway use behaviors: times were longer when fish approached fishway entrances multiple times and when fish entered and exited the fishway more than once.

In this study, three migration behaviors—overshoot of natal tributaries, fallback at dams upstream from natal tributaries, and temporary non-natal tributary use—were evaluated for more than 5200 radio-tagged spring–summer Chinook salmon Oncorhynchus tshawytscha. Over seven years, from 1% to almost 80% of eleven Columbia River study stocks initially overshot natal tributaries and were recorded at upstream Columbia or Snake River dams (mean = 29%). Smaller proportions of each stock were recorded falling back at upstream dams (range = 0–49%, mean = 17%). The contribution of overshoot fallback to total fallback by salmon that returned to tributaries was approximately 20% at The Dalles, John Day, and Ice Harbor dams and was about 40% at McNary Dam. Proportions that temporarily entered non-natal tributaries ranged from 8% to 42% (mean = 22%) of each stock. Overshoot, overshoot fallback, and temporary tributary use behaviors were greatest when spawning tributaries and/or dams were in close geographic proximity. For example, 39% of Klickitat River salmon fell back at The Dalles Dam, 49% of Umatilla River salmon fell back at McNary Dam, and salmon from Bonneville pool tributaries were most likely to temporarily use nearby tributaries. In multivariate models, hatchery origin, fish sex, migration timing, and fallback at both upstream and downstream dams were also associated with non-direct homing behaviors. Overshoot and temporary tributary use events were complex and inter- related, likely reflecting a combination of active searching for olfactory cues from natal tributaries, behavioral thermoregulation, and geographic proximity among sites.","Chinook salmon, Oncorhynchus tshawytscha",Bonneville Dam; Columbia River; Snake River; Lower Granite Dam; The Dalles Dam; John Day Dam; McNary Dam; Ice Harbor Dam; Lower Monumental Dam; Little Goose Dam,salmonids; Federal Columbia River Power System; FCPRS; radiotelemetry; migration; homing behaviors,"University of Idaho, Fish Ecology Research Lab",eng,?,?,application/pdf,Text

Within years, spring– summer Chinook salmon migrated more rapidly as water temperature and date of migration increased; between years, spring–summer Chinook salmon migrated quickly in low-discharge years and slowly in high-discharge years. Steelhead migrations slowed dramatically when summer water temperatures peaked within each year then increased as rivers cooled in fall. Mean summer temperatures explained more between-year variation in steelhead passage rates than did differences in discharge. Fall Chinook salmon also slowed migration through the mainstem Columbia River during warm water periods. Protracted passage times within the hydrosystem were most likely for fish from all runs that fell back over and reascended dams, and for steelhead that sought thermal refugia by straying temporarily into coldwater tributaries. In tributaries and unimpounded reaches, migration date explained the most variance in spring–summer Chinook salmon migration rates while river discharge, migration year and migration reach were secondary. Both within and between years, spring–summer Chinook salmon migrated more rapidly as migration date increased and more slowly when discharge was high.","Steelhead, Oncorhynchus mykiss; Chinook salmon, Oncorhynchus tshawytscha",Bonneville Dam; Columbia River; Snake River; Lower Granite Dam; The Dalles Dam; John Day Dam; McNary Dam; Ice Harbor Dam; Lower Monumental Dam; Little Goose Dam,salmonids; Federal Columbia River Power System; FCPRS; radiotelemetry; migration; passage behavior; fishways; fallback rates; PIT tags; passive integrated transponders,"University of Idaho, Fish Ecology Research Lab",eng,?,?,application/pdf,Text

When fallbacks that occurred more than 24 h after fish first exited fishways and those fallbacks from fish that moved upstream at least as far at Cascade Locks, Oregon (2.5 km) before falling back were removed from analysis, percent fallback averaged 6.2% (+ 2.1%) during the low-spill treatment and 9.3% (+ 2.5%) during the high-spill treatment. Fish that passed the dam using the Bradford Island fishway averaged percent fallback of 14.9% (+ 3.9%) during the low-spill treatment and 20.6% (+ 4.9%) during high spill.

Percent of fish that fell back were not significantly related to spill in regression analysis, which contrasts with results of our analysis of fallback at Bonneville Dam from previous years.

Adult spring and summer Chinook salmon were also radio-tracked in 1998 as a continuation of the 1997 study. In 1996, we determined in the adult passage studies that significant numbers of Chinook salmon fell back over Bonneville Dam, and that most of the fallbacks were fish that had passed the dam via the Bradford Island fishway. In 1997, 991 adult spring and summer Chinook salmon, 577 sockeye salmon, and 975 steelhead were trapped at Bonneville Dam, outfitted with radio transmitters, and released downstream from the dam. In 1998, adult spring/summer (957 fish) and fall Chinook salmon (1022 fish) were trapped, tagged and released downstream from Bonneville Dam, but only a sample of the spring/summer Chinook salmon were tracked in the forebay. As the fish with transmitters reascended the dam and exited the Bradford Island fishway into the forebay, they were followed by boat to determine their route through the forebay of powerhouse I and on upstream. We were particularly interested in routes that led to fallbacks at the dam. Because of high flows in 1997, there was an extended period of forced spill that lasted into July. During the April-July period, 122 spring/summer Chinook salmon, 110 sockeye salmon, and 10 steelhead in 1997, and 129 adult spring/summer Chinook in 1998 were tracked in the forebay of Bonneville Dam.","Steelhead, Oncorhynchus mykiss; Chinook salmon, Oncorhynchus tshawytscha; sockeye salmon, Oncorhynchus nerka",Columbia River; Snake River; Bonneville Dam,salmonids; Federal Columbia River Power System; FCPRS; radiotelemetry; migration; fishways; passage behavior; fallback rates,"University of Idaho, Fish Ecology Research Lab",eng,?,?,application/pdf,Text

Passage conditions were assessed during two treatment conditions: half the powerhouse orifice gates open and all orifice gates closed. Six travel time variables were analyzed using ANOVA analysis and two non-parametric tests. We concluded that closing orifice gates at Priest Rapids and Wanapum dams did not have a significant effect on passage of Chinook and sockeye salmon in 1997. Chinook and sockeye salmon passed through the Hanford Reach section of the Columbia River in 2 to 3 d. Of 217 Chinook salmon that reached Priest Rapids Dam, 199 eventually passed the dam, in 37.6 h, and reached Wanapum Dam. One hundred and ninety Chinook salmon are known to have crossed Wanapum Dam in 20.1 h. Of 440 sockeye salmon that reached Priest Rapids Dam, 427 eventually crossed the dam, in 18.6 h, and reached Wanapum Dam. Four hundred and nine sockeye salmon are known to have crossed Wanapum Dam in 29.7 h. A prototype fishway fence installed inside the west-powerhouse entrance (Lew2) at Priest Rapids Dam was not effective at reducing the number of salmon that exited from the fishway at that point. Salmon were not held up at the fish counting station in the east-shore ladder at Priest Rapids Dam. However, passage times were about three times longer to pass the coded-wire-tag trap near the top of the ladder when the trap was operating as compared to the same section of ladder when the trap was not operating, resulting in median delays 42 min for Chinook salmon and 2.1 h for sockeye salmon. Salmon used the new vertical-slot gate placed at the west-shore fishway entrance (Rew2) as readily as the two other main entrances (Se2 and Se3) at Wanapum Dam. Six (3.0%) Chinook salmon and 16 (3.9%) sockeye salmon fell back at Priest Rapids Dam. Five Chinook salmon and 15 sockeye salmon eventually re-crossed Priest Rapids Dam after an average delay of about 26 h. Eight (4.1%) Chinook salmon and 19 (4.5%) sockeye salmon fell back at Wanapum Dam.

Passage times were assessed during two treatment conditions: half the powerhouse orifice gates open and all orifice gates closed. Travel times from first record in the tailrace to first approach at the dam, to first entry into the fishway, first entry to the junction pool, and to pass the dam were not significantly different with respect to orifice gate closure. Of 119 radio-tagged Chinook salmon monitored at Priest Rapids Dam, 115 salmon eventually crossed the dam. Salmon entered the fishway collection channel mainly at the east-shore and west-powerhouse entrances. There were more entries than exits at the east entrance, but more exits than entries at the west-powerhouse openings. Half the radio-tagged Chinook salmon passed Priest Rapids Dam in less than 37.6 h. About one-third of time to pass the dam was associated with movements in and out of the junction pool area. After entering the junction pool for the first time, most (79%) fish returned to the collection channel and then exited and re-entered the fishway an average of 6.5 times before successfully crossing the dam. Six fish fell back over the dam during this study, for a fallback rate of 5.2%.

Database Delivery: Compile and standardize all data associated with the radio-tagged fish, including filtered (i.e., ‘coded’) radiotelemetry and PIT-tag detection histories into a master database for each species and run; 
Bibliography: Provide a bibliography and key-word index of technical reports and peer- reviewed papers associated with the radiotelemetry studies to expedite researcher and manager access to existing results;
